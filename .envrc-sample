# Sample direnv script demonstrating how to load a Python virtual environment
# automatically upon entering this directory.
#
# Follow these steps to get started. Feel free to change the path to the
# virtual environment ("$HOME/.venvs/imagemanage") to whatever you like, but
# be sure you also modify the single `source` line below.
#
#   mkdir -p $HOME/.venvs/imagemanage
#   python -m venv $HOME/.venvs/imagemanage
#   direnv allow .
#   cp .envrc-sample .envrc
#
# Now, every time you enter this directory, you'll have a working self-
# contained virtual environment.

source $HOME/.venvs/imagemanage/bin/activate
